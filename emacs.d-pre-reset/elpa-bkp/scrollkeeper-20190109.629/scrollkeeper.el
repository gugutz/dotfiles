;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides scrolling commands and several customization
;; options.  The commands use `pulse' to display a quickly fading
;; guideline on the line at which new contents are visible after
;; scrolling.  Also, scrolling can be divided into adjustable steps at
;; the desired speed.  Together, these features help your eyes to keep
;; their place in the buffer while scrolling.

;; To use this package, simply bind these commands to your preferred
;; keys:

;; + `scrollkeeper-up'
;; + `scrollkeeper-down'

;; These packages provide some similar functionality but in very different ways.

;; + https://github.com/michael-heerdegen/on-screen.el: A more complex
;; and comprehensive implementation that uses hooks to observe
;; scrolling in other windows.

;; + https://github.com/ska2342/highlight-context-line/: Highlights
;; the boundary line statically, using a minor mode rather than
;; commands.

;; + https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon: Highlights the cursor rather
;; than the boundary line between new and old content.

;;; TODOs:

;; MAYBE: Use different faces for scrolling down and up.

When the `scrollkeeper-guideline' faces have unspecified
background colors, they are set according to this.  This allows
the guideline faces to automatically adapt to changing themes
without user intervention.

For example, you could set the face name to
`font-lock-string-face', and the attribute keyword to
`:foreground', and the guideline's background color would be set
to the string face's foreground color (which should be visible
against the background in every theme).

Setting the background colors of faces
`scrollkeeper-guideline-highlight' and
`scrollkeeper-guideline-thinline' overrides this setting."

(defface scrollkeeper-guideline-underline

  ;; character on a line to the side of the window.  Not sure if this
  ;; can be fixed.

  ;; FIXME: I picked `font-lock-string-face' because it looks nice
  ;; with my theme.  Maybe not the best default.

  ;; NOTE: Unlike the other two faces, this doesn't need to dynamically
  ;; adapt, because its underline color can be set to the foreground
  ;; color of another face by inheriting from it.

;;;; Functions

;; The first two functions check the background color of the appropriate face and, if
;; unspecified, set it according to `scrollkeeper-guideline-dynamic-background'.  This allows
;; the face to adapt to theme changes without user intervention.  Profiling shows that this
;; checking makes no discernible difference in performance, as e.g. `scrollkeeper--highlight'
;; runs in 0.0004 seconds with and without the checking.  Thanks to Steve Purcell for holding
;; this code to a higher standard.  :)
