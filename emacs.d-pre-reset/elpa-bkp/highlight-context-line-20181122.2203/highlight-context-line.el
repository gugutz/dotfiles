;;; Commentary:

;; This minor mode highlights the last visible line when scrolling
;; full windows.  It was inspired by the postscript viewer gv which
;; does a similar thing using a line across the screen.  It honours the
;; variable next-screen-context-lines.
;;
;; Enable it for the current session with
;;     M-x highlight-context-line-mode
;; or permanently by putting
;;     (highlight-context-line-mode 1)
;; in your init file.
