# i3-gaps WM Rice
This is my personal rice for the i3-gaps WM.

# Requirements

* i3-gaps WM
* i3-blocks

# Installation

Clone the repo to the i3 default config folder.

In archlinux this would be:

    `git clone https://github.com/gugutz/i3-gaps.git ~/.config/i3`

From there, i3 should automatically read the file on the default directory and load the configuration on next restart.
Restart i3. (usually `Mod + Shift + R`)
